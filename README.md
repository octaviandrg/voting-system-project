# Blockchain-Based Voting System

A decentralized voting application built on local Ethereum blockchain that ensures transparent and secure elections.

## Project Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based voting system using Ethereum smart contracts. The system allows for secure voter registration, candidate management, and vote casting while maintaining transparency and preventing fraud.

## Technologies Used

### Blockchain Technologies
- **Solidity (^0.8.0)**: Object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain
  - Used for implementing the election contract logic
  - Handles voter registration, vote casting, and result tabulation
  - Ensures immutable and transparent voting records

- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum
  - Handles contract compilation and migration
  - Provides testing environment
  - Manages contract deployment

- **Ganache**: Local Ethereum blockchain for development
  - Provides test accounts with ETH
  - Enables rapid testing and development
  - Simulates real blockchain behavior

### Frontend Technologies
- **Angular**: Framework for building the client-side application
  - Implements user interface components
  - Manages application state
  - Handles user interactions

### Blockchain Integration
- **Web3.js**: Library for interacting with Ethereum nodes
  - Connects frontend to smart contracts
  - Handles transaction signing and sending
  - Manages contract events and state updates

- **ethers.js**: Alternative library for Ethereum interaction
  - Provides additional utilities for blockchain interaction
  - Handles wallet management and transactions

## Current Progress

### Completed
1. Smart Contract Development
   - Election contract implementation
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Contract deployment setup

2. Basic Frontend Authentication
   - Initial login implementation
   - Basic user session management

### In Progress
1. Frontend Development
   - User interface components
   - Contract interaction logic
   - Voting interface

## Development Notes

### Smart Contract Architecture
- Contract uses pragma solidity `>=0.4.22 <0.9.0`
- Implements election administrator controls
- Handles voter registration and verification
- Manages candidate registration
- Controls election state (start/end)
- Provides vote delegation capabilities
- Includes winner determination logic

### Key Contract Features
- State variables track election data
- Public functions allow external interaction
- Events emit important state changes
- Modifiers ensure proper access control
- Structured data types (structs) for voter and candidate information

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start Ganache for local blockchain
4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
truffle migrate
```
5. Run frontend:
```bash
ng serve
```

## Next Steps
- Complete frontend development
- Implement comprehensive user interface
- Add vote visualization features
- Enhance security measures
- Deploy to test network
